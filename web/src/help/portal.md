# Portal
There are two ways to start the web UI:
- _ash web_ opens and shows the project in the current folder. No authentication required.
- _ash server_ shows a portal with projects available in the local repository.

![](/help/portalTop.png#size=40,align=left)
The top in the portal shows: 
- a filter field
- a button to show the help
- a button to logout


![](/help/portalCenter.png#size=40,align=left)
The center of the portal shows in blue squares all the projects available in the local repository. By clicking on a square, the user opens the related project.

The last two squares __Add Project__ and __Access__ allow to add a new project  and manage the authentication.
