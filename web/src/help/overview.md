# Scrum To Go 0.5
![](/scrum-to-go2.svg#size=20,align=center)

## What is it?
It is a tool to manage your IT work in an almost agile approach

## Why "to go"?
Because:
- simple
- decentralized if you want, meaning *no server*
- hackable for hackers: cmd line tool and store data to Markdown files
- documentation: come with embedded library  
- Git's lover

## How come?
Few years ago I worked with a frugal manager who didn't want to pay for Agile operational tools. I looked for open source solutions but I could not find any. So I build one!

## Why 0.5?
Because I guess it is half the way to be very useful and bugs free.
